Create environment with "conda env create -f environment.yml".

Run "python main.py". "python main.py --help" will list possible arguments, can also be found in config.py. 

For the full code to work, can supply a config.json with a single line of format

{"email": "example@example.com", "password": "jsabkdjbas", "to": "example@example.com"}

to email yourself when code finishes running.
